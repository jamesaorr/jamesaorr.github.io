This dataset is the product of a systematic review conducted by a large international team of ecologists, ecotoxicologists, and environmental scientists, entitled *Studying interactions among anthropogenic stressors in freshwater ecosystems: A systematic review of 2396 multiple-stressor experiments* ([https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14463](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14463)).

The dataset contains 2,396 experiments that tested the individual and combined effects of multiple anthropogenic stressors on freshwater biodiversity and is available in two versions:

- **Static Version**: Available as a [csv file in the  Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11100467).

- **Interactive Version**: Available as a [web application](https://jamesaorr.shinyapps.io/freshwater-multiple-stressors/), where you can visualize, filter, and download subsets of the dataset. The web application can also be used to explore our taxonomy of anthropogenic stressors and our co-occurrence networks of investigated stressors.
