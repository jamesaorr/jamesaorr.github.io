The process of scaling up predictions to higher levels of organization has a surprising consequence: it tends to systematically underestimate the magnitude of system-level change, an effect whose significance grows with the system's dimensionality. This stems from a geometrical observation: **in high dimensions there are more ways to be more different, than ways to be more similar**. This effect, and methods that can be used to account for it, is described in our paper *Scaling up uncertain predictions to higher levels of organisation tends to underestimate change* ([https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13621](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13621)).

We have also provided a ([web application](https://jamesaorr.shinyapps.io/scaling-up-predictions/)) that can be used to visualize and explore this effect. The app also contains code (in R, MATLAB, and Python) that can be used to plot the theoretical expectations
