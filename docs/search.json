I’m an ecologist interested in how stressors impact the diversity, stability, and functioning of ecological communities. I’m particularly interested in the interactions between species that lead to complex dynamics and in the interactions between multiple stressors that make predicting global change impacts so challenging.\nI use a combination of mathematical theory, experimental ecology, and research synthesis in my work. Although much of my research focuses on fundamental questions in theoretical and community ecology, I am also interested in applied questions in the fields of global change biology, (freshwater) environmental science, and microbiology.\nI was recently awarded a Discovery Early Career Researcher Award from the Australian Research Council to study how the temporal synchronization of antibiotics and phages impacts the ecology of bacterial communities and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.\nOn this website, you can find a list of my publications (categorized by topic) and a collection of resources that I’ve produced for other scientists to use."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Global change encompasses many co-occurring anthropogenic stressors. Understanding the interactions between these multiple stressors, whether they be additive, antagonistic or synergistic, is critical for ecosystem managers when prioritizing which stressors to mitigate in the face of global change. While such interactions between stressors appear prevalent, it remains unclear if and how these interactions change over time, as the majority of multiple-stressor studies rarely span multiple generations of study organisms. Although meta-analyses have reported some intriguing temporal trends in stressor interactions, for example that synergism may take time to emerge, the mechanistic basis for such observations is unknown. In this study, by analysing data from an evolution experiment with the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus (~35 generations and 31,320 observations), we show that adaptation to multiple stressors shifts stressor interactions towards synergism. We show that trade-offs, where populations cannot optimally perform multiple tasks (i.e. adapting to multiple stressors), generate this bias towards synergism. We also show that removal of stressors from evolved populations does not necessarily increase fitness and that there is variation in the evolutionary trajectories of populations that experienced the same stressor regimes. Our results highlight outstanding questions at the interface between evolution and global change biology, and illustrate the importance of considering rapid adaptation when managing or restoring ecosystems subjected to multiple stressors under global change."

    "text": "Plant–soil systems are key for understanding the effects of factors of global change. Recent work has highlighted the general importance of considering the simultaneous incidence of some factors or stressors. To help mechanistically dissect the possible interactions of such factors, we here propose three broad groups of mechanisms that may generally lead to nonadditivity of responses within a plant–soil system: direct factor interactions (that is one factor directly changing another), within-plant information processing and crosstalk, and effects of factors on groups of soil biota interacting with plants. Interactions are also possible within and across these groups. Factor interactions are very likely to be present in experiments, especially when dealing with an increasing number of factors. Identifying the nature of such interactions will be essential for understanding and predicting global change impacts on plants and soil."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Uncertainty is an irreducible part of predictive science, causing us to over- or underestimate the magnitude of change that a system of interest will face. In a reductionist approach, we may use predictions at the level of individual system components (e.g. species biomass), and combine them to generate predictions for system-level properties (e.g. ecosystem function). Here we show that this process of scaling up uncertain predictions to higher levels of organisation has a surprising consequence: it tends to systematically underestimate the magnitude of system-level change, an effect whose significance grows with the system’s dimensionality. This stems from a geometric observation: in high dimensions there are more ways to be more different, than ways to be more similar. We focus on ecosystem-level predictions generated from the combination of predictions at the species level. In this setting, the ecosystem’s relevant dimensionality is a measure of its diversity (and not simply the number of species). We explain why dimensional effects do not play out when predicting change of a single linear aggregate property (e.g. total biomass), yet are revealed when predicting change of nonlinear properties (e.g. absolute biomass change, stability or diversity), and when several properties are considered at once to describe the ecosystem, as in multi-functional ecology. As an application we discuss the consequences of our theory for multiple-stressor research. This empirical field focuses on interactions between stressors, defined as the error made by a prediction based on their observed individual effects. Our geometric approach can be visualised and explored with a web application (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4611133), and we provide pseudocode outlining how our theory can be applied. Our findings highlight and describe the counter-intuitive effects of scaling up uncertain predictions, effects that can occur in any field of science where a reductionist approach is used to generate predictions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Human influences have created a world where all ecosystems are exposed to multiple stressors with diverse characteristics and impacts. Organizing this ever-expanding list of stressors presents the opportunity to derive general rules, to understand effects and to improve predictions. Assessing the similarity of anthropogenic stressors can be approached from different perspectives, which we synthesize here. Stressors can be compared by asking what they are (traits), why they are present (sources), where they occur (spatial overlap), when they occur (temporal overlap), how they affect organisms (mode of action) and who they affect (co-tolerance). Some concepts of stressor similarity are thus related to intrinsic features of the stressors themselves (e.g. sources and traits), while other concepts pertain to the similarity of the effects of stressors and are therefore dependent on the ecological scale at which the effects of stressors are measured (e.g. mode of action and co-tolerance). Viewing stressor similarity as a multi-faceted and scale-dependent concept will open new avenues for stressor classification, will enhance predictions of the combined effects of stressors and may even inform the management of novel or emerging stressors."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Winter is a key driver of ecological processes in freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in higher latitudes. Species have evolved various adaptive strategies to cope with food limitations and the cold and dark wintertime. However, human-induced climate change and other anthropogenic stressors are impacting organisms in winter in unpredictable ways. In this paper, we show that global change experiments investigating multiple stressors have predominantly been conducted during summer months. However, effects of anthropogenic stressors sometimes differ between winter and other seasons, necessitating comprehensive investigations. Here, we outline a framework for understanding the different effects of anthropogenic stressors in winter compared to other seasons and discuss the primary mechanisms that will alter ecological responses of organisms (microbes, animals and plants). For instance, while the magnitude of some anthropogenic stressors can be greater in winter than in other seasons (e.g. some pollutants), others may alleviate natural winter stress (e.g. warmer temperatures). These changes can have immediate, delayed or carry-over effects on organisms during winter or later seasons. Interactions between stressors may also vary with season. We call for a renewed research direction focusing on multiple stressor effects on winter ecology and evolution to fully understand, and predict, how ecosystems will fare under changing winters. We also argue the importance of incorporating the interactions of anthropogenic stressors with winter into ecological risk assessments, management and conservation efforts."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Climate change and human land use are considered key threats to freshwater invertebrates. Heatwaves can impact the phenology of insects and population dynamics, yet have been largely ignored in experiments compared to mean temperature changes. Another major anthropogenic stressor driving insect community changes is deposited fine sediment; therefore, effects of key climate-change drivers on invertebrate drift and insect emergence rates may differ between sediment-impacted and non-impacted streams. However, this has never been tested in a realistic outdoor experiment. We investigated the individual and combined effects of two 7-day heatwaves, CO2 enrichment, flow velocity variability (periods of fast and slow), and fine sediment on stream drift and emergence responses, sampled four times during a 7-week experiment in 128 flow-through stream mesocosms. We examined invertebrate drift and insect emergence responses to the four stressors, and used these responses to help explain the benthic invertebrate community responses already assessed (sampled at the end of the experiment). Heatwave 1 strongly increased emergence (dominated by Chironomidae), causing an earlier emergence peak, an effect not repeated during heatwave 2, seven days later. During heatwave 1, emerged chironomids were larger in heated channels, but smaller in heated channels afterwards, suggesting a different effect on body size of short-term heatwaves to previous constant warming experiments. CO2 enrichment reduced drifting EPT and total and Chironomidae emergence on three sampling occasions each. After heatwave 1, total drift and total emergence were strongly reduced by heating in ambient-CO2 channels, whereas no reduction occurred in CO2-enriched channels. During heatwave 2, total drift increased in channels without sediment but not in channels with added sediment. Overall, our findings suggest heatwaves can shift the timing of stream insect emergence, regardless of longer-term mean temperatures. They also show that heatwaves, raised CO2, and fine sediment can modulate each others’ effects on drift and emergence dynamics."

    "text": "Understanding the interactions among anthropogenic stressors is critical for effective conservation and management of ecosystems. Freshwater scientists have invested considerable resources in conducting factorial experiments to disentangle stressor interactions by testing their individual and combined effects. However, the diversity of stressors and systems studied has hindered previous syntheses of this body of research. To overcome this challenge, we used a novel machine learning framework to identify relevant studies from over 235,000 publications. Our synthesis resulted in a new dataset of 2,396 multiple-stressor experiments in freshwater systems. By summarizing the methods used in these studies, quantifying trends in the popularity of investigated stressors, and performing co-occurrence analysis, we produce the most comprehensive overview of this diverse field of research to date. We provide both a taxonomy grouping the 909 investigated stressors into 31 classes, and an open-source and interactive version of the dataset (https://jamesaorr.shinyapps.io/freshwater-multiple-stressors/). Inspired by our results, we provide a framework to help clarify whether statistical interactions detected by factorial experiments align with stressor interactions of interest, and we outline general guidelines for the design of multiple-stressor experiments relevant to any system. We conclude by highlighting research directions required to better understand freshwater ecosystems facing multiple stressors."

Sedimentation may be managed at the catchment scale; thus, uncovering interactions with these three key climate stressors may assist mitigation of future threats. This is the first experiment to investigate the individual and combined effects of enriched CO2, heatwaves, flow velocity variability, and fine sediment on realistic stream invertebrate communities. Using 128 mesocosms simulating small stony-bottomed streams in a 7-week experiment, we manipulated dissolved CO2 (ambient; enriched), fine sediment (no sediment; 300 g dry sediment), temperature (ambient; two 7-day heatwaves), and flow velocity (constant; variable). All treatments changed community composition. CO2 enrichment reduced abundances of Orthocladiinae and Chironominae and increased Copepoda abundance. Variable flow velocity had only positive effects on invertebrate abundances (7 of 13 common taxa and total abundance), in contrast to previous experiments showing negative impacts of reduced velocity. CO2 was implicated in most stressor interactions found, with CO2 × sediment interactions being most common. Communities forming under enriched CO2 conditions in sediment-impacted mesocosms had ~20% fewer total invertebrates than those with either treatment alone. Copepoda abundances doubled in CO2-enriched mesocosms without sediment, whereas no CO2 effect occurred in mesocosms with sediment. Our findings provide new insights into potential future impacts of climate change and land use in running freshwaters, in particular highlighting the potential for elevated CO2 to interact with fine sediment deposition in unpredictable ways."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A robust understanding of the interactions between global and local anthropogenic stressors is crucial for ecosystem management in the Anthropocene. Manipulative experiments in the lab or in the field can be used to build knowledge about the physiological and ecological effects of stressors, but predicting the combined landscape-scale effects of global stressors such as climate change and local stressors such as land-use change requires a different approach. Here we used water quality and hydrology process-based models of entire river catchments in combination with a large biomonitoring dataset to predict the responses of macroinvertebrate communities under different climate change and land-use change scenarios. Using the River Thames in the United Kingdom as a model system, we predicted changes in water quality (temperature, flow, phosphorus, nitrogen, dissolved oxygen) and subsequent changes in macroinvertebrate communities for two climate change scenarios individually and in combination with intensified agriculture and reduced phosphorus pollution (representing improved wastewater treatment). Our models predicted that water quality changes associated with climate change may not influence total species richness, but that community composition will shift towards more pollution-tolerant and common taxa based on responses of community indices and taxon-specific responses. We also found that the negative impacts of climate change on water quality (e.g., increased phosphorus concentration, decreased dissolved oxygen concentration) accumulate through the catchment but that local land-use practices influencing phosphorus dynamics can modify this trend. Furthermore, although the intensified agriculture scenario was predicted to have minimal impacts on macroinvertebrate communities (a result potentially related to shifting baselines as the Thames is already heavily polluted), we found that reduced phosphorus pollution due to improved wastewater treatment was able to mostly offset the negative impacts of climate change on macroinvertebrate communities. Our results demonstrate that using process-based models to study networks of interacting stressors at a landscape scale can provide useful insights into the ecological impacts of anthropogenic global change and adds support to the idea that management of local stressors has the potential to mitigate some of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Plants and ecosystems worldwide are exposed to a wide range of chemical, physical, and biological factors of global change, many of which act concurrently. As bringing order to the array of factors is required in order to generate an enhanced understanding of simultaneous impacts, classification schemes have been developed. One such classification scheme is dedicated to capturing the different targets of global change factors along the ecological hierarchy. We build on this pioneering work, and refine the conceptual framework in several ways, focusing on plants and terrestrial systems: (i) we more strictly define the target level of the hierarchy, such that every factor typically has just one target level, and not many; (ii) we include effects above the level of the community, that is, there are effects also at the ecosystem scale that cannot be reduced to any level below this; (iii) we introduce the level of the landscape to capture certain land use change effects while abandoning the level below the individual. We discuss how effects can propagate along the levels of the ecological hierarchy, upwards and downwards, presenting opportunities for explaining non-additivity of effects of multiple factors. We hope that this updated conceptual framework will help inform the next generation of plant-focused global change experiments, specifically aimed at non-additivity of effects at the confluence of many factors."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Classical models from theoretical ecology are seeing increasing uptake in microbial ecology, but there remains rich potential for closer cross-pollination. Here we explore opportunities for stronger integration of ecological theory into microbial research (and vice versa) through the lens of so-called “modern” coexistence theory. Coexistence theory encompasses a body of theory for disentangling the contributions of different fluctuation-independent (e.g., resource partitioning) and fluctuation-dependent (e.g., environmental variability) mechanisms to species coexistence. We begin with a short primer on the fundamental concepts of coexistence theory, with an emphasis on the relevance to microbial communities. We next present a systematic review, which highlights the paucity of empirical applications of coexistence theory in microbial systems. In light of this gap, we then identify and discuss ways in which: i) coexistence theory can help to answer fundamental and applied questions in microbial ecology, particularly in spatio-temporally heterogenous environments, and ii) experimental microbial systems can be leveraged to validate and advance coexistence theory. Finally, we address several unique, but often surmountable, empirical challenges posed by microbial systems, as well as some conceptual limitations. Nevertheless, thoughtful integration of coexistence theory into microbial ecology presents a wealth of opportunities for the advancement of both theoretical and microbial ecology."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Publishing preprints is quickly becoming commonplace in ecology and evolutionary biology. Preprints can facilitate the rapid sharing of scientific knowledge establishing precedence and enabling feedback from the research community before peer review. Yet, significant barriers to preprint use exist including language barriers, a lack of understanding about the benefits of preprints and a lack of diversity in the types of research outputs accepted (e.g., reports). Community driven preprint initiatives can allow a research community to come together to break down these barriers to improve equity and coverage of global knowledge. Here, we explore the first preprints uploaded to EcoEvoRxiv, a community-driven preprint server for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, to characterise preprint practices in ecology, evolution and conservation. Our perspective piece highlights some of the unique initiatives that EcoEvoRxiv has taken to break down barriers to scientific publishing by exploring the composition of articles, how gender and career stage influence preprint use, whether preprints are associated with greater open science principles (e.g., code and data sharing), and tracking preprint publication outcomes. Our analysis identifies areas that we still need to improve upon but highlight how community-driven initiatives, such as EcoEvoRxiv, can play a crucial role in shaping publishing practices in biology."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Learned societies, as professional bodies for scientists, are an integral part of the scientific system. However, their membership fees have the potential to be prohibitive to the most vulnerable members of the scientific community. To shed light on how membership fees are structured, we conducted a survey of 182 international learned societies relevant to researchers in ecology and evolution. We found that 83% of these societies offered fee concessions to students, but only 26% to postdoctoral researchers. An average regular membership fee was $67.8 USD, student fee – $27.4 USD (42.7% of the regular fee), and postdoctoral fee – $42.7 USD (52.9%). Other types of individual concessions, such as for emeritus, family, or unemployed, were rare (2–20%). Of the surveyed societies, 43% had discounts for members from developing countries (Global South). Such discounts were more common among societies located in high-income countries. Societies with a publicly visible commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion, were more likely to offer different types of concessions. Currently, fees may prevent researchers from vulnerable and underprivileged groups from accessing multiple professional benefits offered by learned societies in ecology and evolution. We recommend tangible actions towards making learned societies more affordable and accessible."

This effect, and methods that can be used to account for it, is described in our paper Scaling up uncertain predictions to higher levels of organisation tends to underestimate change (https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13621).\nWe have also provided a (web application) that can be used to visualize and explore this effect.
