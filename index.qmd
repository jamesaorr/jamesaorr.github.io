### Responses of ecological communities to stressors 

Hello there! I'm an ecologist interested in how stressors impact the diversity, stability, and functioning of ecological communities. I'm particularly interested in the <strong>interactions between species</strong> that lead to complex dynamics and in the <strong>interactions between multiple stressors</strong> that make predicting global change impacts so challenging. 

I use a combination of <strong>mathematical theory</strong>, <strong>experimental ecology</strong>, and <strong>research synthesis</strong> in my work. Although much of my research focuses on fundamental questions in theoretical and community ecology, I am also interested in applied questions in the fields of global change biology, environmental science, ecosystem restoration, and microbiology.

I was recently awarded a Discovery Early Career Researcher Award from the Australian Research Council to study how the temporal synchronization of antibiotics and phages impacts the ecology of bacterial communities and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. This is part of a more general research agenda to understand how multiple stressors can be temporally manipulated to minimize ecological impacts.

On this website, you can find a list of my <a href="/publications.qmd">publications</a> (categorized by topic) and a collection of <a href="/resources.qmd">resources</a> that I've produced for other scientists to use.

## Experience


<div class="timeline-section">

<div class="timeline-item">
  <h3>ARC DECRA, Independent Fellowship</h3>
  <h4>University of Queensland, Australia, 2025 - 2028</h4>
  <p>My research project will leverage novel ecological theory to understand how the temporal synchronization of antibiotic and phage exposure influences the ecology and evolution of bacterial communities. I  will be hosted in Dr. Andrew Letten's microbial ecology research group. I will also work closely with Dr. Siobhán O'Brien at Trinity College Dublin and Dr. Jeremy Barr at Monash University. </p>

<div class="timeline-item">
  <h3>Postdoctoral Researcher</h3>
  <h4>University of Queensland, Australia, 2024 - 2025</h4>
  <p>I am a member of Dr. Andrew Letten’s microbial ecology research group. I am working on questions in fundamental ecology using theory (e.g., consumer-resource modelling, coexistence-theory) and experimental microbial ecology (e.g., using chemostats). </p>
</div>

<div class="timeline-line"></div>

<div class="timeline-item">
  <h3>Postdoctoral Researcher</h3>
  <h4>University of Oxford, UK, 2021 - 2024</h4>
  <p>I worked in Dr. Michelle Jackson’s aquatic ecology research group on the project: "Cumulative impacts of multiple stressors: improving temporal and biological realism".  I used ecological theory, freshwater mesocosm experiments, ecological modelling, and synthesis approaches to study multiple stressor impacts, with a particular focus on the temporal dynamics of stressors. </p>

<div class="timeline-line"></div>

<div class="timeline-item">
  <h3>PhD in Theoretical Ecology</h3>
  <h4>Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, 2018 - 2021</h4>
  <p>My PhD thesis was on the mechanisms of stressor interactions. I studied mathematical and theoretical ecology, multiple-stressor research, and freshwater ecology under the supervision of Dr. Jeremy Piggott, Dr. Andrew Jackson, and Dr. Jean-François Arnoldi. </p>
